  // Exercise 1:
  // Create a page with a blank label and a text area. 
  // When someone types into the text area, change the label to show what the person has typed.

  //   Exercise 2:
  // Using the exercise above, replace the user's typing with the string below. 
  // Each time they press a key, a letter from the string below should display in the label instead. 
  // There's no need to have the text start over from the beginning.

  // Exercise 3:
  // Enhance your solution by creating a reset button that will erase everything from the label
  //  so the user can start over.


  // Exercise 4: Repeating timer
  // Create a button with the text Start Countdown!.
  //  When the User clicks the button, display a countdown sequence in the browser

  // Create additional strings and load them in an array
  // then randomly select one of the three each time the page is reloaded.
